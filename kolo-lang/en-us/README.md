# Kolo Lang


## Why we need Kolo-lang？ 

In the booming big data era of ABC (AI, BigData, Cloud Native), with the gradual improvement of cloud infrastructure, basic software, and algorithm models, efficiency is gradually becoming a pain point for engineers to implement data platforms and complete AI engineering. Whether it is from the replacement of infrastructure, the replacement of easier-to-use frameworks, or the recruitment of better R&D talents, it is impossible to effectively and greatly improve efficiency.

We believe that only in the **programming language level** innovation can fundamentally improve the efficiency of data platform landing and AI engineering.

- SQL for AI™️, declarative fusion imperative language, SQL-like syntax is simple and flexible. 
- Cloud native design, Kolo engine support K8s and other cloud deployment, make full use of cloud computing power and storage. In addition, deployment modes such as Yarn are supported as well.
- A single underlying engine supports distributed manipulation of large amounts of data and manipulation of data.
