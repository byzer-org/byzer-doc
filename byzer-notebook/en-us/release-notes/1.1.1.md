Publish Date：`2022-03-30`

It's a pleasure to announce that we just updated Byzer Notebook to the latest version ：Byzer Notebook 1.1.1.

Byzer Notebook is an open-source web interactive computing (Web IDE) application platform based on the Byzer engine. Byzer Notebook provides a unified platform and language for business analysts, data scientists, and IT engineers to write and run code interactively, enabling users to bridge complex data links and achieve low-cost data analysis and AI landing.

**Important change:** A field in the job_info table has been optimized in Byzer 1.1.1.
