# Byzer Notebook Introduction

Byzer Notebook is a web interactive computing (Web IDE) application platform based on the Byzer engine.

Byzer Notebook provides a unified platform and language for business analysts, data scientists and IT engineers, support interactively writing and running code. Moreover, in Byzer Notebook, support for table entry and table exit of multiple data sources and training and publishing of AI models can better help users open up complex data links and achieve low-cost data analysis and AI landing.



### Component

* Documentation

All interactive calculations, documents, mathematical formulas, pictures and other rich media input and output in Byzer Notebook are embodied in the form of documents. These documents are `JSON` format files with the suffix `.mlnb` or `.mlwf`, which are not only convenient for version control, but also for sharing with others.

* Web application

Byzer Notebook is a web-based application platform that supports encoding mode and markdown document mode, making it easy to create and share program documents, and supports real-time code, mathematical equations, interactive calculations, visual workflows and other rich media forms.

* Workflow

Byzer Notebook not only supports interactively writing and running code, but also provides a visual workflow, which is convenient for you to import, clean, analyze, train, predict and store data sets by dragging and dropping, and complete it in a low-code way, end-to-end data analysis experience.

### About Byzer Community

Byzer is a new and dynamic open source project, its predecessor is MLSQL. In the Byzer community, we will build a collection of applications such as Byzer Notebook, Byzer Runtime engine, Byzer runtime extension, Byzer vscode extension, etc. around the Byzer language.

Data developers are welcome to join and build a community ecosystem.
