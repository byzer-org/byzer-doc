# Byzer-lang 2.3.0 Release Note

Release Date: `2022-04-29`

We are pleased to announce that today we officially released the `Byzer-lang 2.3.0` version, which provides a more flexible and stable Byzer engine.

### **Main Update**

1. n this version, we have optimized the installation and deployment process of Byzer engine, separated configuration files from executable scripts, introduced environment checks, and optimized the display of terminal information. User can change the configuration by modifying the property files in `${BYZER_HOME/conf`, and can start, stop, restart the Byzer engine by execute `${BYZER_HOME/bin/byzer.sh start | stop | restart}`. This change brings a  huge improvement in ease of use and maintainability. Details please refer to the [BIP 3: Optimize Byzer lang script](https://github.com/byzer-org/byzer-lang/wiki/BIP-3:-Optimize-Byzer-lang-script)，the example as below

In the `2.3.0` version, we optimized the packaging logic of the Byzer engine and fixed some bugs (see [byzer-org/byzer-build](https://github.com/byzer-org/byzer-build)), unifies the project structure and usage of each product offer, and optimizes the file directory structure of the [official download site](https://download.byzer.org/), Fix the naming problem left over in the project, hoping to bring a better experience to community users.
