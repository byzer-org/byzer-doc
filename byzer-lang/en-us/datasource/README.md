# Load and store multiple data sources

Before reading this chapter, please read [Byzer-Lang Guide](/byzer-lang/en-us/grammar/outline.md) and [Load](/byzer-lang/en-us/grammar/load.md). You need to be familiar with the basic concepts related to data loading in Byzer.

Byzer has the ability to load and store multiple data sources. The supported data sources are as follows:
- JDBC
- RestApi
- ElasticSearch
- Solr
- HBase
- MongoDB
- HDFS/Local storage
- Special data sources

In this chapter we will give descriptions and usage examples of these data sources.
