# Container deployment

Byzer provides various deployment methods for users to flexibly deploy and use in different scenarios:

- [Sandbox standalone deployment](/byzer-lang/en-us/installation/containerized_deployment/sandbox-standalone.md): We have packaged Byzer-lang, Byzer-notebook and MySQL into one Sandbox image, to help you quickly experience Byzer functionalities locally.

- [Multi-container deployment](/byzer-lang/en-us/installation/containerized_deployment/muti-continer.md): In this mode, the Docker Compose will define and run the Byzer-lang, Byzer-notebook and MySQL images uniformly, to support features such as health check and life cycle management.

- [K8S deployment](/byzer-lang/en-us/installation/containerized_deployment/K8S-deployment.md): Sandbox K8S provides a Command Line Tool (CLI) to deploy MLSQL engine on K8S.
