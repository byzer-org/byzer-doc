# Byzer Language


## Why do we need Byzer-lang？ 

In the booming era of big data (AI, BigData, and Cloud-Native), with the constant improvements in cloud infrastructure, basic software, and algorithm models, efficiency has become the bottleneck for engineers to work on data platforms and AI engineering. Whether it is to replace infrastructure, upgrade to an easier-to-use framework, or recruit qualified R&D talents, we cannot easily achieve the efficiency we really want.

We believe that only innovation at the **programming language level** can truly improve the efficiency in data platform launching and AI engineering.

- SQL for AI^™️^, declarative + imperative language, with SQL-like simple and flexible syntax; 
- Cloud-native design, Byzer engine support K8s and other cloud deployments, make full use of cloud computing power and storage. In addition, deployment modes such as Yarn are supported as well.
- One language + one engine,  offer an out-of-the-box feature to cover data + AI.
